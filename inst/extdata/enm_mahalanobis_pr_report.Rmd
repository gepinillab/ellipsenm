This is the final report produced during the execution of the function `ellipsoid_model` from the <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/ellipsenm" target="_blank">**`ellipsenm`**</a> package. Following, a complete description of the ecological niche modeling process for the species *`r as.character(data[1, 1])`* is presented. An ecological niche, from a Grinnellian perspective, is the set of environmental conditions that allow a species to maintain populations for long periods of time, without immigration events (Peterson et al. 2011). Models created with the **`ellipsenm`** package are ellipsoid envelope models and assume that a species ecological niche is convex, has an only optimum, and the species response to each variable covaries with the response to other variables (see Brown 1984, Jimen√©z et al. 2019, Osorio-Olvera et al. 2019). Mahalanobis distances are used to represent how far is each combination of environmental conditions from the optimum (ellipsoid centroid). Given the type of prediction selected in the execution of the `ellipsoid_model` function, this report presents results for Mahalanobis distances.

Note 1: If only one replicate was performed, results are obtained using the hole set of data. If multiple replicates were performed, results are produced per replicate; as each replicate is build with a sub-sample of the data, results may differ among replicates. For replicated models, mean results are shown in this report, results for all replicates, as well as for mean, minimum, and maximum ellipsoidal models can be found in the output directory defined in the function `ellipsoid_model`. If the model was performed with replicates, further raster calculations can be performed to show model variability (e.g., range or other indicators of model variability; see Peterson et al. 2018)  

Note 2: This is the report for a model projected into scenarios other than the one used for calibration. Therefore, other results correspondent to predictions for each of the projection scenarios were created in the output directory defined in the function `ellipsoid_model`. This report includes graphical and numeric results for only one of these projections (generally the first of all projections if multiple, or the only projection if a single one was performed). The reason for presenting only one projection is the prevention of RAM-related issues.

Note 3: If more than tree dimensions were used to create the model, up to three of them will be used in graphical representations.

Tip: To see two dimensional figures in their actual size click on them. Three dimensional figures are interactive.

# Summary

The model presented in this report was produced for the species *`r as.character(data[1, 1])`* to measure distances from the centroid of its niche to each of the available environmental conditions in the area of interest. The  modeling process was performed with `r ifelse(replicates > 1, paste0(replicates, " replicates"), "1 replicate")`.`r if (replicates > 1) {ifelse(replicate_type == "bootstrap", paste0(" Replicates were produced using bootstrapped subsamples of ", bootstrap_percentage, "% of the data.", " Replicates were produced by excluding one occurrence record at the time."))}` Based on the level used to produce the ellipsoids (`r as.character(mean_pred@level)`) the error (*E*) assumed for the occurrence data was `r as.character(100 - mean_pred@level)`%. This is, `r as.character(100 - mean_pred@level)`% of the occurrence data is considered as potentially erroneous (i.e., environmental outliers); therefore, this data is not included in the ellipsoid envelope model for the species ecological niche.

This model was projected to `r length(scenarios)` scenario(s). The results for all projections can be found in the output directory defined in the function `ellipsoid_model` under the name(s): `r if (length(scenarios) > 1) {paste0(paste(scenarios[-length(scenarios)], collapse = ", "), ", and ", scenarios[length(scenarios)])} else {as.character(scenarios[1])}`. Graphical and numerical results are presented only for the `r as.character(scenarios[1])` scenario.

## Data used for modeling

A total of `r nrow(data)` occurrences and `r n_var` variables (`r paste0(paste(variable_names[-length(variable_names)], collapse = ", "), ", and ", variable_names[length(variable_names)])`) were used to produce the models.

# Predictions in environmental space

Given the data and the characteristics that define the species ellipsoidal niche (see [Data used for modeling] and [Ellipsoid characteristics]) the results in environmental space are presented bellow. 

## Calibration area

The calibration area is represented by the variables given to fit the ellipsoid using the `ellipsoid_model` function. This area is recommended to be a region that has been accessible to the species for a relevant period of time (see Barve et al. 2011). Although most methods used in the **`ellipsenm`**  package are not sensible to a background (environmental conditions in the calibration area), having a well defined accessible area helps with interpretations. Bellow, a `r paste(ifelse(n_var > 2, "3", "2"), "dimensional")` representation of the ellipsoidal niche model and the Mahalanobis distances is shown in environmental space for the calibration area.

```{r Figure4, fig.cap="Representation of Mahalanobis distances in environmental space. Occurrence data is represented in blue. Cold colors represent long distances and warm colors short distances."}
col1 <- rev(color_palette(nrow(r_values)))

if (n_var > 2) {
  el3d <- ellipse3d(mean_pred@covariance_matrix[1:3, 1:3],
                    centre = mean_pred@centroid[1:3], 
                    level = mean_pred@level / 100)
  
  ob <- new("ellipsoid", method = mean_pred@method, 
            centroid = mean_pred@centroid[1:3], 
            covariance_matrix = mean_pred@covariance_matrix[1:3, 1:3],
            level = mean_pred@level)
  suit <- predict(ob, r_values[, 1:3], "mahalanobis", TRUE)
  
  vals <- cbind(r_values[, 1:3], suit@mahalanobis)
  vals <- vals[order(vals[, 4], decreasing = F), 1:3]

                 centre = mean_pred@centroid[1:2], 
                 level = mean_pred@level / 100)
  xlim <- range(range(el1[, 1]), range(r_values[, 1]))
  ylim <- range(range(el1[, 2]), range(r_values[, 2])) 
  
  ob <- new("ellipsoid", method = mean_pred@method, 
            centroid = mean_pred@centroid[1:2], 
            covariance_matrix = mean_pred@covariance_matrix[1:2, 1:2],
            level = mean_pred@level)
  suit <- predict(ob, r_values[, 1:2], "mahalanobis", TRUE)
  
  vals <- cbind(r_values[, 1:2], suit@mahalanobis)
  vals <- vals[order(vals[, 3], decreasing = F), 1:2]
  
  par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
  plot(vals, col = col1, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, 
       xlab = variable_names[1], ylab = variable_names[2])
  points(data[, 4:5], pch = 19, col = "blue3") 
  lines(el1, col = "darkgreen", lwd = 1.5)
}
```

## Projection scenario

A `r paste(ifelse(n_var > 2, "3", "2"), "dimensional")` representation of the ellipsoidal niche model and the Mahalanobis distances is shown in environmental space for the `r as.character(scenarios[1])` scenario.

```{r Figure5, fig.cap="Representation of Mahalanobis distances in environmental space for a scenario of projection. Occurrence data is represented in blue. Cold colors represent long distances and warm colors short distances."}
col1 <- rev(color_palette(nrow(pr_values)))

if (n_var > 2) {

  vals <- cbind(pr_values[, 1:2], suit@mahalanobis)
