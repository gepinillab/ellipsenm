Description: ellipsenm is an R package that implements multiple tools to help in
    using ellipsoid envelopes to model ecological niches of species. Handly 
    options for calibrating and selecting models, producing models with replicates 
    and projections, and assessing niche overlap are included as part of this 
    package. Other functions implemented here are useful to perform a series of 
    pre- and post-modeling analyses.
